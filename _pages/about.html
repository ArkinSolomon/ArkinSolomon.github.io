      Hi, I'm Arkin Solomon. I am 18 years old and I love to code. Coding has always been something I've been interested in from a young age. I learned to code when I was in 5th grade, starting with Java. I then learned basic AppleScript syntax and wrote a few quiz games in AppleScript until I discovered Khan Academy and their computer science section, written in JavaScript. I learned to make spin-offs of code and write basic syntax. To this day JavaScript is my main language.
      <br><br>
      From 7th grade to the beginning of 9th grade I didn't really code much. I got bored after aimlessly writing code and having no type of goal. But at the end of 9th grade I decided to actually start coding and taking things seriously. Since then, I have dabbled in a lot of different areas of code and tried out multiple languages. I have made games, authentication systems, NPM packages, Discord bots, Minecraft plugins, and much more. I am studying computer engineering at Cedarville University and hope to work as either a flight software developer, or creating autonomous vehicles.
      <br><br>
      I can pick up on new programming techniques and new languages very quickly. I have experience with C#, HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript (and Node.Js), C++, and Python. I am currently working on Google's IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate, on top of college and furthering my experience on my own.

        Hi, I'm Arkin Solomon. I'm a full-stack software engineer, currently working as a software developer at London
        Computer Systems. I graduated from Cedarville University in May of 2025 with a B.S. in computer engineering,
        minoring in both computer science and Bible.
        <br><br>
        I can pick up on new programming techniques and new languages very quickly. I have experience with C and C++, C#,
        Dart (with Flutter), HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript (browser/Node.Js/Bun/React/Angular), and Python, among other
        programming languages and technologies. I also have embedded development, FPGA development, and VHDL experience.
        <br><br>
        I started programming in early high school and improved my skills through high school classes, before joining
        the computer engineering program at Cedarville. While managing my course workload, I worked for the university's
        web services department my junior and senior years, and got to be on the University's NASA student launch team
        my senior year. Before the summer of my senior year, I did a co-op with London Computer Systems, where I now
        work full-time as a software developer. You can checkout all of my projects <a href="/projects">here</a>.

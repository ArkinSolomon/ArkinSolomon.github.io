      Hi, I'm Arkin Solomon. I am 19 years old and I love to code. Coding has always been something I've been interested in from a young age. I learned to code when I was in 5th grade, starting with Java. I then learned basic AppleScript and wrote a few quiz games in AppleScript until I discovered Khan Academy and their computer science section, written in JavaScript. I learned to make spin-offs of code and write basic programs. To this day JavaScript is my main language.
      <br><br>
      From 7th grade to the beginning of 9th grade I didn't really code much. I was soon bored after aimlessly writing code and having no specific goal in mind. Towards the end of 9th grade I decided to actually start coding and taking things seriously. Since then, I have explored different technologies and learned more languages. I have created games, NPM packages, Discord bots, Minecraft plugins, and much more. 
      <br><br>
      Currently, I am studying computer engineering at Cedarville University and aspire to work as a software developer.
      <br><br>
      I can pick up on new programming techniques and new languages very quickly. I have experience with C#, HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript (and Node.Js), C++, and Python. I have completed the Google IT Automation with Python Certificate. Whilst managing my workload at Cedarville, I am also working on personal projects. You can checkout all of my projects <a href="/projects">here</a>.
